// `chorus daemon` — the assembled client daemon. Wires together:
//   CredentialResolver → ChorusClient (MCP) + SseListener (+ reconnect backfill)
//     → EventRouter → WakeQueue → Waker (LineageResolver + ClaudeSpawner)
// On a task_assigned (and other wake actions) it spawns a local headless Claude
// Code, serialized per DIRECT idea, that acts via the chorus_* MCP tools. The
// Claude session id is the dispatched entity's direct idea uuid (deterministic,
// so a human can `claude --resume <idea-uuid>`); new-vs-resume is decided by
// probing the on-disk transcript — there is no persisted session-id map.
//
// Connection / session / transcript reporting to the server is intentionally
// NOT done here — the no-op UploadHooks reserve those seams for the derived
// observability idea.
