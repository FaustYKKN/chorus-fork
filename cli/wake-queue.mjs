// Per-key FIFO scheduler with a global concurrency cap. Keys are opaque strings
// chosen by the caller (EventRouter). Today the key is the SERVED DIRECTORY
// (Layer 1 — per-cwd serialization): all wakes for one cwd share a lane, so the
// 2nd waits for the 1st subprocess to EXIT — never two opencode editing one
// working tree, and (since a session's transcript is cwd-bound) never two
// `--resume <sameSession>` against one session either.
//   • within one key (one served cwd) → strictly serial, FIFO.
//   • across keys (different cwds) → concurrent, bounded by maxConcurrency
//     (now a pure resource cap: how many directories run at once).
//   • enqueue() returns immediately — never blocks the SSE loop.
//   • a task that throws is logged and the next task for that key proceeds (a
//     poisoned wake must not wedge the key's queue forever).
// Plain ESM, zero deps, in-memory.
