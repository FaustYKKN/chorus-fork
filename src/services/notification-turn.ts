// src/services/notification-turn.ts
// Wake-notification → DaemonSessionTurn bridge (子1 — daemon-session-conversation).
//
// `notification.service` create/createBatch is the SINGLE chokepoint where every
// wake-triggering Notification row is born — symmetric for autonomous wakes
// (task dispatch / @mention / elaboration / PM-flow transitions) and the human-typed
// instruction (子2). This module is the bridge that, for such a notification destined
// for a DAEMON agent, records the corresponding `DaemonSessionTurn` so the daemon's
// Claude conversation gains one turn per wake.
//
// It NEVER reimplements session/turn logic — it composes the daemon-session service
// (`resolveOrCreateSession` + `createPendingTurn` + `resolveDirectIdeaUuid`) and the
// connection registry (`listConnectionsForAgent`, to pin the cwd-bound origin).
//
// ONLINE-ONLY WAKE: only an ONLINE connection is wakeable. When the agent has NO online
// connection at all, no turn is created — the already-created Notification stands as the
// plain record (a fully-offline target is a notification-only event; there is NO durable
// queue / backfill of pending turns).
//
// DIRECTED LIVE DELIVERY (fix-pinned-wake-directed-delivery, T1): a PINNED autonomous wake
// (`mentioned` with a markup pin, or an assignment wake whose Task / root Idea is pinned to
// an `agent_instance`) and the idea-anchored `elaboration_verified` wake are DIRECTED so
// only the resolved instance wakes — mirroring the `human_instruction` keystone (子2). When
// such a wake resolves to an ONLINE target connection, the turn is created against THAT
// connection's session and a `deliver_turn` control ping is emitted on its
// `control:{connectionUuid}` channel (fire-and-forget + non-fatal; the persisted turn +
// reconnect backfill are the durability net). The resolved target is also surfaced
// TRANSPORT-ONLY to the daemon (see `WakeTurnResult.targetConnectionUuid`) so non-target
// daemons suppress their broadcast copy.
//
// SOFT vs HARD PINS (the offline policy splits on the pin's ORIGIN — resolves the
// proposal-review BLOCKER; see `PinnedTarget.soft`):
//   - HARD pin = a `mentioned` wake (a human typed an exact `(host, cwd)` in markup). An
//     offline hard pin is NOTIFY-ONLY, NO WAKE — a deliberate REVERSAL of #354's "offline
//     pin → online-first": no turn, no ping, no target; the already-created Notification
//     stands as the plain record. Silently re-routing a human-typed place to a cwd the
//     author did not choose is the user-visible defect this preserves the fix for.
//   - SOFT pin = an ASSIGNMENT wake (the Task's own `agent_instance` override, or the
//     inherited root-Idea instance). An offline soft pin DEGRADES to the agent's
//     online-first connection (R2 graceful un-pin) — the unreachable instance is treated as
//     a plain agent, so the agent still wakes; never notify-only, never a hang.
// An UN-PINNED wake is unaffected and still goes broadcast → online-first.
//
// FAILURE ISOLATION (repo "no silent errors" + the wake notification must always
// survive): turn creation runs AFTER the notification row already exists, and any
// throw is logged VISIBLY (never swallowed) but is NOT propagated — a lost turn must
// never abort or block the notification that was already created. The caller invokes
// this fire-and-forget; it returns the created turn (for tests / callers that want it)
// or null when no turn was created (recipient is a human, the agent has no online
// daemon, the action is not wake-triggering, or creation failed and was logged).

// ===== Action → trigger mapping =====
//
// The `Notification.action` values that imply the daemon should ACT are the daemon's
// wake set (`cli/prompts.mjs` WAKE_ACTIONS) intersected with what actually flows
// through `notification.service` (a persisted Notification row). Verified against the
// code, NOT memory:
//   - `notification-listener.ts` resolveNotificationType emits the prefixed action
//     forms: task_assigned, task_verified, task_reopened, idea_claimed,
//     proposal_approved, proposal_rejected, elaboration_requested,
//     elaboration_answered (plus non-wake noise: task_status_changed,
//     task_submitted_for_verify, comment_added, report_created).
//   - `mention.service.ts` creates `action: "mentioned"` directly (bypasses the
//     listener), which IS a wake action.
//   - `resource_resumed` is a SYNTHETIC control-channel dispatch (子3) — it is NEVER
//     a persisted Notification, so it cannot reach this chokepoint and is therefore
//     deliberately absent here.
//   - `human_instruction` is the UI-sent instruction (子2): the chokepoint receives a
//     Notification with that action and the free-text body in `instructionText`.
//
// The `DaemonSessionTurn.trigger` enum is the NARROW 6-value taxonomy
// (task_assigned | mentioned | elaboration | elaboration_verified | resume |
// human_instruction). This table collapses each wake action into its canonical
// trigger category so every wake-triggering notification yields exactly one turn:
//   - @mention                                   → mentioned
//   - elaboration request / answer               → elaboration
//   - elaboration verified (human-verify wake)   → elaboration_verified (distinct from
//                                                  the "answer the questions" elaboration
//                                                  trigger — this one means "write the
//                                                  proposal")
//   - human-typed instruction                    → human_instruction
//   - every other autonomous dispatch (task
//     assignment, task reopen/verify unblock,
//     idea claim, proposal approve/reject)       → task_assigned (the autonomous
//                                                  task-dispatch trigger)
//

// created (the daemon would not wake on it either). Exhaustive + explicit so a
// reviewer sees exactly which actions map where — no implicit fallthrough.

 * cwd where the idea's transcript already lives. It applies ONLY when the idea is NOT
 * pinned to an instance: an instance-pinned idea is resolved earlier as a SOFT pin (the
 * root-idea step of `resolvePinnedTarget`), which yields a `directed` (or degraded
 * online-first) selection and therefore SKIPS this upgrade. When no idea-anchored session
 * exists yet (the idea was elaborated entirely in the UI and the daemon was never woken on
 * it), or that origin is not currently online, this returns null → the caller falls back
 * to online-first (NO directed delivery), byte-identical to the pre-change wake.
 *
 * Shared by every trigger in `IDEA_SESSION_ORIGIN_UPGRADE_TRIGGERS` — originally the
 * `elaboration_verified` proposal-writing wake, now generalized so `proposal_approved` /
 * `proposal_rejected` / `idea_claimed` / task wakes (all mapped to `task_assigned`) and the
 * `elaboration` wakes land where the idea's conversation already runs instead of a random
 * online cwd (fix-proposal-wake-session-origin).
 *
 * `directIdeaUuid` is the idea anchor (the session business key for an idea-anchored
 * session); a null anchor (a non-idea-anchored wake, e.g. a standalone task) short-circuits
 * to null so the widened gate cannot mis-fire. `connections` is the agent's live registry,
 * already resolved by the caller. A query failure propagates to the caller's
 * failure-isolation guard.

 * It is `true` ONLY for an `offline_pin` selection — a PINNED wake whose pin matched NO

 * SSE event and suppresses the broadcast wake on EVERY connection (Q2 — notify-only, no
 * wake), realizing the design's "no daemon matches → every connection suppresses" intent
 * without depending on a non-null sentinel. It is `false` for an un-pinned wake (so the
 * broadcast wakes online-first, byte-identical to before), for a directed wake (the target

 * (never reimplements) the daemon-session service:

 *  1. Map `action → trigger`; bail if the action is not wake-triggering.
 *  2. Only agent recipients can be daemons — bail for `user` recipients.
 *  3. Resolve the wake's pinned target instance via assignment LINEAGE (cwd-addressable
 *     instances): the mention's `(host, cwd)` for a `mentioned` wake (HARD); else the
 *     Task's own `agent_instance` override, then the root Idea's `agent_instance` assignee
 *     under the same-agent guard (both SOFT); else none (DEC-5: NEVER inferred from the
 *     project). Select the ONLINE origin, classified by HOW it was chosen:
 *       - `directed`     — pin matched an ONLINE connection (turn delivered to ONLY it).
 *       - `online_first` — un-pinned (or a SOFT pin that degraded because its instance is
 *                          offline) → first online (broadcast → online-first).
 *       - `offline_pin`  — a HARD (mention) pin matched NO online connection → notify-only,
 *                          NO turn, NO fallback (REVERSES #354). A SOFT pin NEVER lands here.
 *       - `none`         — agent fully offline → NO turn (the notification stands).
 *  4. `elaboration_verified` / `idea_claimed`: the idea's `agent_instance` assignee (step 3)
 *     is the HIGHER-priority soft pin and is resolved above. ONLY when the idea has no
 *     assignee-instance (selection stayed `online_first`) does the LOWER-priority
 *     session-origin heuristic apply: if the idea has an existing ONLINE session origin,
 *     UPGRADE the selection to `directed` on that origin so the proposal-writing wake lands
 *     where the idea's conversation already lives — else stay `online_first`.
 *  5. Derive the session id: the entity's `directIdeaUuid` via lineage when the entityType
 *     is lineage-walkable, else the entity uuid (ad-hoc). For a CROSS-CWD directed mention
 *     (the resolved target differs from the idea's existing session origin), the resolved
 *     INSTANCE participates in the session business key so each `(host, cwd)` keeps its own
 *     cwd-bound transcript — NEVER re-pointing the existing session's origin (which would
 *     `No conversation found` on `--resume`).
 *  6. `resolveOrCreateSession` (origin + directIdeaUuid write-once on create) then
 *     `createPendingTurn` with the mapped trigger. For `human_instruction`, the turn's
 *     `promptText` is the instruction body (canonical); every other trigger has a null
 *     promptText (the daemon rebuilds the autonomous prompt from notification context).
 *  7. DIRECTED wake only: emit a `deliver_turn` control ping on the target connection's
 *     `control:{connectionUuid}` channel carrying the precise `turnUuid` (reuses the
 *     `human_instruction` keystone `deliverTurnPing`). Fire-and-forget + non-fatal (the
 *     persisted turn + reconnect backfill are the durability net). Surface the target.
 *
 * FAILURE ISOLATION: any throw from steps 3-7 is caught, logged VISIBLY, and swallowed —
 * a turn-creation/ping failure MUST NOT abort or block the already-created notification.
 * Returns `{ turn, targetConnectionUuid }` (turn null + target null when no turn created).
